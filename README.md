# Conan Sigstore Plugin

Plugin for signing Conan packages using the Sigstore tools.

The goal of this plugin is to serve as a base example on how to implement a plugin for signing and verifying Conan
packages, in this case, leveraging the tools provided by sigstore such as Cosign and Rekor.

Feel free to clone this repo and modify the plugin with you own needs.

**Sigstore tools:**

- **Cosign:** For signing and verification of artifacts and containers, with storage in an Open Container Initiative (OCI)
  registry, making signatures and in-toto/SLSA attestations invisible infrastructure.

- **Rekor:** Append-only, auditable transparency log service, Rekor records signed metadata to a ledger that can be 
  queried, but canâ€™t be tampered with.


## How does the plugin work?


When the packages are prepared for the upload (`conan upload`), the packages are signed following this process:
  1. It creates a `files-sha256.txt` summary file with the files and their hashes. It is stored in the metadata/signature folder. 
  2. It creates a `files-sha256.txt.sig` signature file using `cosign`. It is stored in the metadata/signature folder.
  3. The files at metadata/signature folder are then uploaded alongside the package artifacts.
  2. If rekor is enabled, the signature of the package is registered against the rekor public log.

When the packages are installed (`conan install`) or when they are integrity-checked in the cache
(`conan cache check-integrity`), the packages are verified following this process:

  1. The `files-sha256.txt.sig` is verified using `cosign` against the public key provided.
  2. If rekor is enabled, the signature of the package is also verified against the rekor public log.


## Demo
