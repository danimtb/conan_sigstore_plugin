# Conan Sigstore Plugin

Plugin for signing Conan packages using the [Sigstore tools](https://www.sigstore.dev/).

The goal of this plugin is to serve as a base example on how to implement a plugin for signing and verifying Conan
packages, in this case, leveraging the tools provided by Sigstore such as Cosign and Rekor.

**Feel free to clone this repo and modify the plugin with you own needs**.

This plugin is implemented following the **package signing plugin interface**.
Read more about it in the documentation: https://docs.conan.io/2/reference/extensions/package_signing.html
And the latest changes introduced at: https://github.com/conan-io/conan/pull/18785

### Sigstore tools used by the plugin

- **[Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign):** For signing and verification of artifacts and containers,
  with storage in an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry, making signatures and in-toto/SLSA attestations invisible
  infrastructure.

- **[Rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor):** Append-only, auditable transparency log service, Rekor records signed 
  metadata to a ledger that can be queried, but canâ€™t be tampered with.


## How does the plugin work?

When the packages are prepared for the upload (`conan upload`), the packages are signed following this process:
  1. It creates a `sign-summary.json` summary file with the provider that signs the packages, the files in the package
     and their hashes. It is stored in the metadata/sign folder.
  2. It creates a `sign-summary.json.sig` signature file using `cosign`. It is stored in the metadata/signature folder.
  3. The files at metadata/sign folder are then uploaded alongside the package artifacts.
  4. If rekor is enabled, the signature of the package is registered against the rekor public log.

When the packages are installed (`conan install`) or when they are integrity-checked in the cache
(`conan cache check-integrity`), the packages are verified following this process:

  1. The `sign-summary.json.sig` is verified using `cosign` against the public key provided.
  2. If rekor is enabled, the signature of the package is also verified against the rekor public log.

## Requirements

The following executables should be installed and in the PATH of your system.

- ``cosign``: https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases
- ``rekor-cli``: https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/releases

## Installation

To install this plugin, the easiest way is to use the ``conan config install`` command:

```bash
$ conan config install https://github.com/danimtb/conan_sigstore_plugin.git
```

The plugin will be installed at ``<CONAN_HOME>/extensions/plugins/sign/sign.py``.

## How to generate a keypair to sign packages

To use this sigstore plugin, first generate a compatible keypair and define the environment variables for the keys:

```bash
$ cosign generate-key-pair --output-key-prefix mykey
Enter password for private key:
Enter password for private key again:
Private key written to mykey.key
Public key written to mykey.pub
```

This will generate a ``mykey.key`` private key and a ``mykey.pub`` public key.

Note that you may be prompted to introduce a password for your keypair that will be required in the sign process.
The password should be set as ``COSIGN_PASSWORD`` environment variable for the plugin to signing the packages.

## Signature summary file structure

The format of the `sign-summary.json` file is the following:

```json
{
  "provider": "<name of the agent signing the package>",
  "method": "sigstore",
  "files": {
    "<file1>": "<sha-file1>",
    "<file2>": "<sha-file2>"
  }
}
```
Description of the contents:

- **provider**: Name of the angent that is signing the package. This is also used in the verification process to choose the
  right keys to verify.
- **method**: Method use to sign the packages. This is useful to indicate different signing formats
  (`openssl`, `gpg`, `minisign`, `signify`...) and to be able to support them for signing and verification inside the
  plugin. Currently the only method implemented is `sigstore` (using `cosing` and `rekor` tools).
- **files**: This is a sorted dictionary with filenames and their respective `sha256` checksum of all the package files.

## Environment Variables

- ``COSIGN_PASSWORD``: Set the password of your private key. This is used when using the private key to sign packages.
- ``CONAN_SIGN_PLUGIN_ENABLE_SIGN``: Enable plugin's sign feature (enabled by default).
- ``CONAN_SIGN_PLUGIN_ENABLE_VERIFY``: Enable plugin's verify feature (enabled by default).
- ``CONAN_SIGN_PLUGIN_ENABLE_REKOR``: Enable sign and verify using the Rekor CLI and rekor log  (disabled by default).

## Configuration

The configuration file should be named ``sigstore_config.yaml`` and placed 
at ``<CONAN_HOME>/extensions/plugins/sign/sigstore_config.yaml``.

If the plugin runs for the first time and the configuration file does not exist, it will create a template
file for easier customization.

```yaml
# Use this section to declare the name of the provider that signs the artifacts,
# the references that apply to be signed, and the path to the keys.
sign:
  enabled: true                                 # (bool) Enable the signature of packages.
  use_rekor: false                              # (bool) Enable uploading the signature to the public Rekor transparency log.
  references:                                   # (list) References or pattern of references that should be signed.
    - "**/**@**/**"
    - "mylib/1.0.0"
  exclude_references:                           # (list) References or pattern of references that should NOT be signed.
    - "**/**@"
    - "**/**@other_company/**"
  provider: "mycompany"                         # (string) Name of the provider used to sign the packages.
  method: "sigstore"                            # (string) Name of the tool used to sign the packages.
  private_key: "path/to/mycompany-private.key"  # (path -relative to this config file-) Private key to sign the packages with.
  public_key: "path/to/mycompany-public.pub"    # (path -relative to this config file-) Public key to sign the packages with.

# Use this section to verify the references for each provider using the corresponding public key.
verify:
  enabled: true                                     # (bool) Enable the verification signature of packages.
  providers:                                        # (list) Providers that sign the packages for verification.
    conancenter:
      references:                                   # (list) References or pattern that should be verified.
        - "**/**@"
      exclude_references:                           # (list) References or pattern that should NOT be verified.
        - "zlib/1.2.11@"
      public_key: "path/to/conancenter-public.pub"  # (path relative to this file) Public key to verify the packages with.
      use_rekor: false                              # (bool) Enable verifying the signature against the public Rekor transparency log.
    mycompany:
      references:
        - "**/**@**/**"                             # Example pattern to verify all the references for mycompany provider.
      exclude_references:
        - "**/**@**/testing"                        # Except for those references that have testing as channel.
      public_key: "path/to/mycompany-public.pub"
      use_rekor: true
```

Each ``provider`` is set to be associated with a key.
- In the case of signing, it should be associated to its public-private keypair (``private_key``, ``public_key``).
- In the case of verifying, only the public key is required.
